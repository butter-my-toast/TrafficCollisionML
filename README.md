# Traffic Collision Severity Predictor (WIP)

![Project Status: Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Work%20In%20Progress-yellow)

This project aims to predict the severity of traffic collisions using pre-collision factors. The predictor leverages data from the California Highway Patrol Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (CHP SWITRS) database.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: This project is currently under development. The goal is to create an accurate machine learning model that can predict the severity of traffic collisions based on available pre-collision information.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning classification algorithms.
- Uses data from the CHP SWITRS database.
- Predicts collision severity based on pre-collision factors.
